Hot day - The Sound That Vanishes
The Sound That Vanishes: Scrollhouse Entry Test #0
Hot day.
The thermometer registered a fraction of a degree over 100 in the shade. The slight occasional breeze did little to evaporate any of the sweat which kept forming on my forehead, inching its way ever so slowly towards the eyebrows which always seemed to funnel into, instead of away from, my eyeballs.
Days like today made me long for one of those Army haircuts they give new recruits. Long hair and hot, humid weather do not mix! Remembering the sunburned scalp always kept me from taking some clippers and simply cutting it all off.
But what made it seem even hotter was the slight smoke of the wildfires, casting everything in a weird shade of yellowish-green light. Trees in the distance appeared hazy and washed out, but the sky ran a gradient from gray at the horizon to a hazy blue directly overhead.
The chirping crickets were the icing, which was rapidly melting, on this sweltering hot day of a cake.
Cricket chirps are a unique thing in that the sound appears somewhere inside your head. If you turn your head around, new crickets replace old crickets as different ones enter and leave the receptive nature of the human ear. We hear in a telescopic way from opposite sides of our head. Our brain takes the information it receives via electrical impulses and deciphers a location.
The particular sound that a cricket makes is such that it is hard to pinpoint, because when you face directly towards or directly away from a particular source, it disappears, and others which used to be in that region appear.
The only way to find the cricket is when you cannot hear it.
I wondered if Lao Tsu or the Buddha had made the same observations along their journey. They had clearly said similar things: "To find, you must stop seeking," and the like.
Crickets in the background make a day seem at least ten degrees hotter than it feels.
This thinking train stopped in Conditioned Responseville and made a connecting stop in Transmutationton.
Closing my eyes and imagining it was night instead of day helped it feel 100-ish again.
When I awoke from my nap...
